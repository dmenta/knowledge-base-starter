# Development Philosophy

> 📝 **Template Note:** Customize this to reflect your team's actual values and practices.

This document captures our core beliefs and values about software development. These principles guide our decisions and shape how we approach problems.

---

## Core Values

**Clarity Above All**
- Code is read far more than it's written
- Write for the next person (often your future self)
- Clarity is an act of kindness to your collaborators
- Simple solutions are usually better than clever ones

**Quality is Incremental**
- Perfect code doesn't exist, but better code does
- Small improvements compound over time
- Leave code cleaner than you found it
- Progress over perfection

**Understanding Before Building**
- Don't start coding until you understand the problem
- Ask questions when requirements are unclear
- Explore the domain before jumping to solutions
- Sometimes the best code is the code you don't write

## How We Build Software

**Test-First, Always**
- Every feature begins with a failing test
- One test at a time—focus, implement, refactor
- Tests reveal the design; don't fight them
- Red-green-refactor is our rhythm (see [testing.md](testing.md))

**Work in Small Steps**
- Write one test, make it pass, refactor, commit
- Never refactor on red—get to green first
- Commit after every successful refactor
- Small steps make problems easier to debug

**Let the Code Emerge**
- Don't design everything upfront
- Write the test, write the simplest code, refactor to reveal patterns
- The design emerges through the refactoring step
- Trust the process—over-engineering comes from skipping steps

**Domain-Driven Design**
- Model the business domain in code
- Use domain language everywhere (see [domain-language.md](domain-language.md))
- Business rules live in domain objects
- Keep infrastructure concerns at the edges

---

## Design Principles

**Pure Domain Model (DDD)**
- Business rules belong in domain objects, not services
- Domain objects have no infrastructure dependencies
- Keep the core pure—no databases, no HTTP, no frameworks
- Services coordinate; domain objects decide
- Domain model returns values or raises domain exceptions
- This makes testing trivial and reasoning clear

**Separation of Concerns**
- Domain layer: pure business logic, no external dependencies
- Service layer: coordination, orchestration, and boundary protection
- Infrastructure layer: databases, APIs, external systems
- Exceptions at service boundaries (validate input, catch domain exceptions)
- Clear boundaries make testing and changes easy

**Explicitness**
- Make dependencies and relationships obvious
- Implicit behavior breeds confusion
- Prefer verbose and clear over terse and clever

**Testability**
- If it's hard to test, it's probably poorly designed
- Pure domain model = easy testing, no mocks needed
- Tests guide better architecture

---

## What We Value

**Behavior Over Implementation**
- What the code does matters more than how
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Implementation can change; behavior should stay stable
- Focus on contracts and interfaces, not internals

**Discovery Over Planning**
- Tests reveal what the code needs to be
- Refactoring reveals the right abstraction
- Small steps reveal the path forward
- Trust emergence over upfront design

**Discipline Over Improvisation**
- Red-green-refactor: no shortcuts
- One test at a time: resist the urge to skip ahead
- Commit after refactoring: preserve progress
- The rhythm produces quality

**Domain Clarity**
- Use the language of the business domain
- Business rules in domain objects, not scattered in services
- Pure domain model makes everything easier
- Code should read like the domain expert talks

**Error Handling Philosophy**
- Domain objects raise exceptions for violated business rules
- Services catch and handle exceptions at boundaries
- Don't let exceptions leak across architectural layers
- Make error messages helpful for debugging

## Our Commitment

We strive to:
- Build systems that are easy to understand and change
- Make thoughtful decisions and document them (see [decisions.md](decisions.md))
- Test our assumptions and verify our work
- Learn continuously and update our practices
- Collaborate with respect and curiosity

We acknowledge:
- Not all code will be perfect
- Sometimes pragmatism trumps principle
- Technical debt happens—manage it consciously
- Context matters—adapt principles to the situation

*These are ideals to aspire to, not rigid rules. Use judgment, adapt to context, and always prioritize delivering value.*
