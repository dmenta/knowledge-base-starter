# Contributing to the Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is a living document that grows with our project and understanding. Here's how to keep it current and valuable.

---

## When to Update

Update the knowledge base when you:
- **Discover new preferences** - "We always do X this way now"
- **Establish new patterns** - A pattern emerged and we want to repeat it
- **Make important decisions** - Record it in [decisions.md](decisions.md)
- **Learn from mistakes** - Update guidelines to prevent repeat issues
- **Change practices** - Old guidance no longer applies

---

## How to Update

1. **Make the change** - Edit the relevant file(s)
2. **Keep it concise** - Each file should stay under 400 words
3. **Be specific** - Concrete examples over abstract principles
4. **Commit with context** - Explain why in the commit message
5. **Share with the team** - Announce significant changes

---

## File Guidelines

**Each file should:**
- Focus on one topic
- Be skimmable (use headers, lists, tables)
- Cross-reference related files
- Include examples when helpful
- Stay under 400 words (exceptions allowed for decisions.md)

**Avoid:**
- Duplication across files
- Implementation details that change frequently
- Language-specific syntax (unless this is language-specific project)
- Overly general advice that applies to all software

---

## Reviewing Changes

When someone updates the knowledge base:
- Read the changes carefully
- Discuss if you disagree or have questions
- Propose alternatives if you see a better way
- Approve once consensus is reached

This isn't just documentation—it's our shared understanding. Treat it seriously.

---

## Maintenance

**Monthly:**
- Review all files for accuracy
- Remove outdated guidance
- Add new learnings from recent work

**When onboarding:**
- New team members should read the entire knowledge base
- Their questions reveal gaps or unclear sections
- Update based on their feedback

**When changing direction:**
- Mark superseded decisions in decisions.md
- Update affected files
- Consider adding an ADR explaining the change

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something belongs in the knowledge base, ask:
- **Is it unique to how we work?** → Probably yes
- **Will we reference it repeatedly?** → Probably yes
- **Is it obvious or universal?** → Probably no
- **Does it change frequently?** → Probably no (or put it elsewhere)

When in doubt, propose it and discuss with the team.
